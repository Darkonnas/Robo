Homework no 4, using 2 Piezo Buzzers (1 active and 1 passive), 1 Button and 2 100Ohms Rezistors;

The passive buzzer detects knock from the user (knockTreshold controls the intensity) and, in 5 seconds time, starts the active buzzer with a standard Buzz tone (HIGH). 
The user then has to press the button in order for the active buzzer to stop.

NOTES: I've made the active buzzer's sound consist of constant beeps because my ears are fond of the continuos piercing sound :)).
Plus it sounds like an alarm that way, and I tend to think that could be a possible application for this.
