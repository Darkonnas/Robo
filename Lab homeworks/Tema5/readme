Components: 
- Arduino Uno board x 1
- Joybutton x 1
- 4 digit 7 segment display x 1
- 1k Ohm resistor x 4 (used for 4D7SD D1..4 Digit Selector pins)
- lots of cables

Synopsis:
-The X Axis of the Joybutton controls the "blinkingDigit" i.e what digit is currently under observation, if no digit is already selected
  ->The "blinkingDigit" blinks at a constant interval, signalling its digit
-The Y Axis of the Joybutton controls the value of the current selected digit, if one is selected
  ->The selected digit will have its decimal point active, signalling its selection
-The Pushbutton of the Joybutton selected/ deselects the current "blinkingDigit" or "selectedDigit" respectively
